Data Wrangling
==============

The commands here operate mostly on a per-column-basis.

.. code:: python

   import seaborn as sns
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   df = sns.load_dataset('penguins')

Add a Column
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   # set entire column to same value
   df['col1'] = 7

   # use list-like data (pd.Series and np.array work as well)
   data = list(range(df.shape[0])) # create list of correct length
   df['col2'] = data

Remove a Column
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   del df['col1']

Column Arithmetics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   df['body_mass_kg'] = df['body_mass_g'] / 1000

   # log-transform
   df['log_body_mass'] = np.log(df['body_mass_g'])

Change Column Data Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   # convert to string
   df['mass'] = df['body_mass_g'].astype(str) + 'g'

Set the Index Column
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index is a special column of a DataFrame, because it is treated
differently by many operations in pandas.

.. code:: python

   # put the species column in the index
   df_species = df.set_index('species')

   # now you can select by species easily:
   df_species.loc['Gentoo']

Note that the ``inplace=True`` parameter modifies the DataFrame instead
of returning a new one:

.. code:: python

   df.set_index('species', inplace=True)

This notation is more memory-efficient, but it is more tricky in Jupyter
notebooks (e.g. when you run that line twice you get different results.

To move the index to a regular column, use:

.. code:: python

   df_reset = df.reset_index()  # inserts a numerical index

Missing Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Missing values are a common phenomenon. A quick way to diagnose missing
values is:

.. code:: python

   df.isna().sum().plot.bar()

Often, you might simply want to kick out all rows in which a None or NaN
occurs:

.. code:: python

   df_dropped = df.dropna(inplace=False)  # same logic as with set_index()

Alternatively, you might want to fill in a best guess value:

.. code:: python

   df_fixed = df.fillna(42)
   # or
   df_fixed = df.fillna(df.median())

There are many, many strategies to fix missing values (imputation
methods).

Concatenate multiple DataFrames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   # suppose you have multiple DataFrames with the same columns
   df1 = df.sample(5)
   df2 = df.sample(5)
   df3 = df.sample(5)

   # connect them to one DataFrame vertically
   df_all = pd.concat([df1, df2, df3])

Swap Rows and Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operations (especially plotting) are easier to implement if you
turn a DataFrame by 90°:

.. code:: python

   df.transpose()

Iterate
~~~~~~~

Usually, it is possible to write one-liners or concise expressions that
get the job done. If this is not possible (or you are still learning
this stuff and can’t figure out a better way yet), you may want to fall
back to a ``for`` loop over all the rows.

for index, row in df.iterrows(): print(index, row[‘body_mass_g’]
