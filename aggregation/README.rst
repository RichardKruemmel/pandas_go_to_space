Aggregation
===========

-  ``s.mean()`` - calculates the mean
-  ``s.median()`` - calculates the median
-  ``s.std()`` - calculates the standard deviation
-  also try ``s.sum()`` ``s.count()`` ``s.min()`` ``s.max()``
-  ``df.groupby(col).agg_func()`` - groups by a column and runs an
   aggregation function over each group (see above for choices for
   agg_func).
